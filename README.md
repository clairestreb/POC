# POC
Proofs of Concept

I will upload the code when I get the chance.  In the meantime, go to http://clairenstreb.brinkster.net/poc where you will see two mobile applicatons written in ASP.NET, C#:

- One that demonstrates responsiveness.  If you are on your computer, go to the URL and resize your browser window to be small like a phone, and you can see how the display automatically changes based on your window size.  (Actually, I did not write this, SirajGadhia did.)

- The other demonstrates offline/online detection.  If you are connected to the internet, go to the URL and you will see Online shown.  If you then disconnect from the internet, you will see the Online change to Offline, and notice what happens when you click Save then go Online again.
